# The configuration and usage of socat below requires an explanation.
# The intent is to provide an out-of-the-box Evergreen instance able to run  builds using Docker.
# The chosen path for this is to require that the Docker socket be bind-mounted.
#
# As the Jenkins instance user is *not* root, it can not use /var/run/docker.sock by default
# in a typical setup. Because when mounted with `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` the
# socket will not be writable to the world, and depending on the setup not even readable.
#
# So, there are two paths forward:
# * Either we require that the administrators on the host run `chmod a+rw /var/run/docker.sock`, or
# * we just expose that file as a full TCP socket, listening on the usual 2375 port.
#
# We chose the latter because it seemed less work for the Evergreen users, and hence more in line
# with the overall easiness Jenkins Evergreen aims at providing.
